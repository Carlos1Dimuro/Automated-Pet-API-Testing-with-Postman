**Postman Collection and Environment for Petshop API**

**Description**

This repository contains a Postman collection and environment designed for comprehensive testing of the Petshop API. The collection includes various endpoints to manage pets in the system, such as creating, updating, and deleting pet records. Both positive and negative test cases have been created to ensure the correct functionality of the API and to handle potential errors.

**Repository Contents**

Create Pet: Tests the functionality to add a new pet to the system.
Get Pet: Verifies that the information of a specific pet can be retrieved using its ID.
Update Pet: Evaluates the ability to modify the data of an existing pet.
Delete Pet: Ensures that a pet can be correctly deleted from the system.
List Pets: Validates the retrieval of a list of all registered pets.

Postman Environment (petshop-api-environment.json): Configures the necessary variables for running the tests. It includes:

Base URL: The base URL for the Petshop API.
Pet ID: A dynamic variable that stores the pet ID generated during the tests.

**Test Cases**

Positive Cases: Verifies that the system performs the expected operations correctly when provided with valid data.
Negative Cases: Assesses how the system handles unexpected situations or invalid data, ensuring that it responds appropriately to errors and exceptions.

**Features**

Automation with Newman: The collection is designed to be run automatically with Newman, allowing for integration into CI/CD pipelines and facilitating regular automated testing.
